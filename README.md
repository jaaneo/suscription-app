# Getting Started with Create React App dobleB. template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a template for a React project with the following features:

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn lint`

Runs the linter. It will check for any linting errors and will fix them if possible. You can also run `yarn lint:fix` to fix all the errors automatically. You can modify the linting rules in the `.eslintrc.js` file.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn precommit`

Runs the linter and test runner before every commit. If there are any linting errors or failing tests, the commit will be aborted. You can modify the precommit script in the `package.json` file.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Config files
